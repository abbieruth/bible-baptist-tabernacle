<h1>Bible Baptist Tabernacle</h1>
 <p>I am building a website for my church.  It's not live anywhere yet as it is still a work in progress but I plan to have it up by August at the latest!</p>

<p>This is just a quick layout and background.  So far it's mostly lorem ipsum for text and no images, but updates are coming soon!</p>

<h2>How it's made</h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS</p>
<p>I'm using HTML for all the text, images, etc, and CSS for all the design.  I don't think I'll need any JavaScript for this project, but it's still in its early days 
so we'll see.  I've done all the coding in Visual Studio Code so far.</p>
